abstract: "Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is the most commonly used method to repair abdominal aortic aneurysm and can be performed using a variety of anaesthetic techniques including general, local and regional anaesthesia (GA, LA and RA respectively). Non-randomized studies have suggested potential patient benefit when local and/or regional techniques are used. A recent systematic review examining mode of anaesthesia for EVAR (39,744 patients from 22 non-randomized studies) reported a lower unadjusted risk of death after emergency EVAR with LA compared to GA, but trends in elective EVAR were less clear. There are no randomized controlled trials to guide practice in this area therefore the best choice of anaesthetic technique remains unknown. The aim of this study was to quantify the use of different modes of anaesthesia for elective EVAR across all UK vascular centres, and to assess the effect of anaesthetic technique on early clinical outcomes.


The UK National Vascular Registry was interrogated for patients undergoing elective, standard infra-renal EVAR between 1st January 2014 and 31st December 2016. Patients with a symptomatic aneurysm treated semi-electively were excluded. The primary outcome was in-hospital death within 30-days of surgery. Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications and length of hospital stay. Time-to-event outcomes were compared using Cox Proportional Hazards regression adjusted for confounders including British Aneurysm Repair score and chronic lung disease. 


A total of 9,783 patients received an elective, standard infra-renal EVAR (7,069 GA; 2,347 RA; 367 LA) across 89 hospitals. RA and/or LA was used in 82 hospitals.  There were 64 in-hospital deaths within 30-days: 50 in the GA group (0.9% mortality at 30-days, 95% confidence interval [0.7-1.2%]), 11 in the RA group (0.6% [0.3-1.1%]) and 3 in the LA group (1.5% [0.5-4.7%]). The mortality rate differed between groups (p=0.03) and was significantly lower in the RA group compared to the GA group (adjusted hazard ratio RA/GA: 0.37 [0.17-0.81]; LA/GA: 0.63 [0.15-2.69]). The median length of stay was 2 days for all modes of anaesthesia, but patients were discharged from hospital more quickly in the RA and LA groups compared to the GA group (adjusted hazard ratio RA/GA: 1.10 [1.03-1.17]; LA/GA: 1.15 [1.02-1.29]). Overall, 20.7% of patients experienced one or more complications (GA group: 22.1%; RA group: 16.8%, LA group: 17.7%). Pulmonary complications were recorded most frequently and occurred with similar frequency in the three groups (overall 2.4%, adjusted odds ratio RA/GA: 0.93 [0.66, 1.32]; LA/GA: 0.82 [0.41, 1.63]). 


30-day mortality was lower with RA compared to GA, but mode of anaesthesia was not associated with increased complications for patients undergoing elective, standard infra-renal EVAR. This work is valuable in demonstrating the equipoise surrounding the choice of anaesthetic technique for elective EVAR and the need for a high quality randomized controlled trial comparing the different anaesthetic techniques."
